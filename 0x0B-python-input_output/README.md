In this project, we learned what files are and how we can access and manipulate them. We saw Python read file, write file, Open file and close file.

Storing your programâ€™s data into a file increases the application and usability of your program. The utility of your application is also increased when you are able to get data from a file into your program. Now that you know how to work with files (open, process and close them), you can build better programs.
